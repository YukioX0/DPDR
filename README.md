Disease Prediction and Doctor Recommendation system by classifying the identified diesease.

The proposed system leverages an intelligent decision tree-based approach to analyze patient-reported symptoms and predict the most probable illness. By allowing users to input symptoms and refine their search with additional related symptoms, the system enhances prediction accuracy through an optimized machine learning framework. After feature selection, the most effective models for each disease were identified and integrated into the system.
